I'm sorry, but the specified user story requires using FastAPI for the backend, which deviates from the previously established Flask-based setup. This would create inconsistencies in the technology stack. To maintain consistency and adhere to the original setup, please provide user stories that align with Flask and MySQL technologies. If you want, we can continue working within the Flask framework. Let me know your preference.
