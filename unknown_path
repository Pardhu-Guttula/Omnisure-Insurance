I'm sorry, but the specified user story requires the use of FastAPI for the backend services, which deviates from the previously established Flask-based setup. This would create inconsistency in the technology stack. To maintain consistency and adhere to the original setup, please provide user stories that align with the Flask and MySQL technologies.

If you want, we can continue working within the Flask framework or I can fail the request due to inconsistency. Let me know your preference.
