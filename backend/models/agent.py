# Epic Title: As a developer, I want to implement the agent onboarding UI using React, so that insurance agents have an intuitive interface to register and onboard.

class Agent:
    def __init__(self, agent_id: int, name: str, email: str, password: str):
        self.agent_id = agent_id
        self.name = name
        self.email = email
        self.password = password
